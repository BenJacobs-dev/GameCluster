# GameCluster

All of my random small Java apps, currently they are all run independantly but I hope to create a main application to quickly navigate between them.

## Current Game List:

### Minesweeper:

Just a basic minesweeper game. You are able to chose the map gird size and precentage of the grid that is bombs. Not very optimized, this was the first project in this cluster and is the oldest. Currently uses a grid of buttons, which is quite computationally intense, i will be changing this in the future.

### Fractal:

This allows you to create a bunch of 2D fractals. Quite fun to mess around with and make different patterns.

### Pong:

Placeholder folder. When i started making pong i thought about block breaker games and decided that was a better option to make first.

### BlockBreaker:

Very basic version of blockbreaker. As i was making this i had a cool idea from another project and didnt get this finished how i wanted it, but it is working.

### MazeViewer:

Allows for the creation of large mazes and then allows you to automatically solve them. This was a small portion of a ray caster project i was working on that i expanded out to visualize it better. If you plan on manually solving this maze make sure you start from where the maze creation starts, as through how the maze is created it is very easy to solve backwards

### PatternMaker:

Creates a cool pattern that morphs over time. Very trippy. Very computationally intensive, currently its running on the CPU but when i figure out how to run it on the GPU it should provide huge speed improvements.

### IKFun:

This is an inverse kinematics simulator, lots of options for moving the ends of the "rope" and even allowing simple animation creation. I may improve apon the animation system and the interactablity of this, but that will require a large rewrite, which i currently dont have the time to do.

### Gravity

A clone of the Android app [Particle Flow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nfaralli.particleflow&hl=en&gl=US). A bunch of paticles are generated and can create attraction points (Black Holes) using the right click, and drag them around with left click.

### Percolation

A visalization of Percolation, idea from [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-767WnbaCQ&t)

### LeafMaker

A WIP fork of my 2D fractal maker that creates a green shadow around the fractal. The plan is to create the vein patterns in leaves (the fractal component) and connecting leavifiness (the green haze)
